# Ultimate Duckov Statistics v0.8.0 — pre-release candidate

M8 keeps a continuous expedition as one run across proven Duckov full-scene and subscene transitions. It adds explicit starting/ending maps, ordered repeated-map-aware segments, separate transition displacement, event-time M1-M7 segment attribution, schema 8, Runs route presentation, and four joinable route CSVs. Automated validation and the single-map, multi-map, repeated-map re-entry, later-map death, cross-map M1-M7, abrupt recovery, UI, export, shutdown, and review-hardening gates pass. M8 is merged into `main`; no tag, release publication, or Workshop upload has occurred.

## Included in v0.8.0 candidate

- Public-hook route lifecycle using `SceneLoader`, `MultiSceneCore`, `LevelManager`, exact main-duck `SetPosition`, and restored `InputManager.InputActived` evidence.
- Stable visited-map identity from `MultiSceneCore.ActiveSubSceneID` when present, otherwise the proven full-scene ID; no localized-name identity, object ID, scene scan, or timing guess.
- Segment-local M1-M7 aggregates plus preserved source/outcome association for delayed healing and combat.
- Physical, proven teleport, and transition/loading-excluded movement as separate categories whose overall values compose from segment totals.
- Separate historical starting-map complete-run totals/records and new segment-derived route-map totals.
- Schema-8 migration that preserves prior data and marks route history unavailable without fabricating segments; incomplete current-schema profiles and checkpoints are rejected before atomic selection so an intact backup can win.
- Successful high-rate firing mutations are checkpointed through a bounded one-second scheduler instead of synchronously cloning and durably writing the growing route from every firing callback.
- Accepted item uses publish independently to lifetime and active-run destinations, so a failed lifetime save cannot silently omit the run, segment, association, or route-map contribution.
- `routes.csv`, `segments.csv`, `segment_events.csv`, and `route_map_totals.csv`; existing map scopes are explicitly named `starting_map`.
- Defensive bounds of 64 visits and 2,048 association rows with route-only capability degradation.
- Delayed outcomes with no proven active destination segment preserve overall statistics and truthfully disable only event attribution and route-map totals.

## Acceptance status

The single-map, two-map extraction, seven-segment Nullpunkt → Lagerbereich → Keller → Lagerbereich → Keller → Lagerbereich → Farmstadt expedition, repeated-map re-entry, later-map death, representative cross-map M1-M7 activity, abrupt interruption/recovery, UI, persistence, export, clean shutdown, and deployment-readback gates pass and are recorded in `TESTING.md`. Post-correction controls with the Vektor SMG, Electrified MP7, and MF assault rifle confirm a broader firing-related frame-time problem rather than a weapon-specific Vektor issue. Frame loss occurs while firing into empty space and worsens when hits add combat activity. The earlier per-shot checkpoint defect was real and is corrected, but the live result does not yet prove the remaining UDS contribution; active M8.1 owns a game-only versus UDS-enabled baseline followed by profiling and hardening across the cumulative M1-M8 firing, projectile, combat, attribution, and persistence paths because earlier milestones did not run an equivalent controlled sustained-fire stress case. No safe reproducible delayed cross-segment healing/damage case was identified; the source/outcome implementation is covered by production-path regressions and remains truthfully capability-gated during loading.

## Published v0.7.0 history

M7 unique-container statistics were merged and published as the GitHub `v0.7.0` pre-release on 2026-08-12. M0-M7 are therefore published through v0.7.0. No Steam Workshop upload has occurred.

## Included in v0.7.0

- One count per unique normal non-corpse container whose loot access successfully begins for the exact main duck during an active raid.
- Per-run deduplication by the verified private `InteractableLootbox.GetKey()` result. Closing and reopening the same container does not increment; a later run receives a fresh deduplication scope.
- Lifetime, per-map, and compact per-run aggregation with saturating non-negative counters.
- A bounded 4,096-key active-run checkpoint. Hitting the defensive bound disables the run metric rather than evicting identities and risking double-counting.
- Crash/interruption recovery that carries both the accepted total and exact stable-key set into the interrupted run summary.
- Overview and Runs presentation, full schema-7 JSON, container columns in `runs.csv`, `run_totals.csv`, and `map_totals.csv`, plus the flattened `containers.csv`.
- Schema-7 migration preserving M1-M6 and marking all pre-M7 history explicitly unavailable.
- Visible repair provenance for malformed container aggregates and semantic rejection/backup recovery for inconsistent current-schema active-run container checkpoints.

## Native contract and truth boundary

M7 is verified against Duckov 2.3.30:

- Public `InteractableLootbox.OnStartLoot : Action<InteractableLootbox>` is invoked by `StartLoot()` only after the interaction timer has completed and `Inventory` is non-null. Proximity, interaction start, locked/missing requirements, cancellation, and failed `StartLoot` do not reach this event.
- The event-time protected `InteractableBase.interactCharacter` must reference the exact `CharacterMainControl.Main` and report `IsMainCharacter`.
- Private `InteractableLootbox.GetKey() : int` is the canonical position-derived identity already used by Duckov's lootbox inventory cache. UDS invokes only this version-probed method; it never persists a Unity runtime object ID.
- Native enemy death lootboxes are marked through a narrowly owned prefix/finalizer on private `CharacterMainControl.OnDead(DamageInfo)` plus a postfix on `InteractableLootbox.CreateFromItem(...)`. Persisted and player tombs are recognized from Duckov's exact `LootBoxPrefab_Tomb` argument.
- The corpse-provenance patches use their own Harmony owner. Callbacks become inert before exact-owner unpatching; cleanup remains retryable and blocks unsafe replacement.
- Any missing/changed member, unsafe foreign patch, runtime stable-key failure, or patch-set drift marks the capability `DisabledIncompatible` and stops recording approximate numbers.

“Container looted” means successful access to the loot interface. M7 does not claim that an item was removed and does not count item quantity or value.

## Compatibility and migration

- Verified baseline: Duckov `2.3.30`, Steam build `24013657`, Unity `2022.3.62f2`, HarmonyLib `2.4.1.0`.
- Schema-6 and older profiles migrate to schema 7 without reconstructing container history.
- Existing M1-M6 aggregates, run summaries, capabilities, checkpoints, exports, and generation identity remain intact.
- Missing or invalid container roots are repaired with provenance. A current-schema active checkpoint whose unique total and stable-key set disagree is rejected so atomic backup recovery can choose a valid candidate.

## Known limitations

- Statistics begin when their milestone is installed; pre-v0.7.0 container history is unavailable, not a genuine zero.
- The native stable key is position-derived. Unknown or modded non-corpse lootboxes work when they use the verified class and stable-key contract; incompatible implementations remain uncounted and disable the capability if they reach the successful-access event without usable identity.
- Native corpse classification covers installed Duckov enemy death paths, persisted dead bodies, and player tombs. Third-party corpse systems that bypass all verified native death/create contracts are outside the proven capability.
- A sudden process or OS failure can lose up to approximately one second of newly accepted container/combat/equipment state because mutation checkpoints are intentionally coalesced. Orderly shutdown and run completion flush state.
- Version 0.7.0 stores one stable root/starting map per run. Multi-map expeditions are not yet represented as ordered routes, and complete run totals remain grouped under that stored map. Planned M8 adds route segments and event-time per-map attribution without reconstructing historical routes.
- UDS remains a local GitHub package. Only HarmonyLib is supplied through Steam Workshop.

## Acceptance state

Focused M7 regressions, the complete Release suite, native contract probe, warning-free native build, formatting, source safety, package/extraction audit, deployment readback, and the user-controlled gameplay matrix are recorded in `TESTING.md`. PR #7 merged as commit `172125abd59d2398d18b00e8512dc69acbab8f63`; the published pre-release tag points to that merge commit. The validated ZIP and SHA-256 sidecar are attached to the GitHub release.
