# Ultimate Duckov Statistics

Ultimate Duckov Statistics (UDS) is a local, single-player statistics mod for Escape From Duckov. Version 0.2.0 records successful consumable uses and the actual HP those items restore to the main duck in raids. Activation counts, amount consumed, and healing remain separate metrics.

The mod never modifies Duckov save files. Its data is stored under:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\TeamSoda\Duckov\UltimateDuckovStatistics\
```

## Status

M0 and M1 are complete. M2 healing attribution is under validation on `feat/healing-attribution`. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the product contract and [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the exact validation protocol.

## Build prerequisites

- Windows
- .NET 8 SDK
- A local Escape From Duckov installation
- Steam Workshop item [HarmonyLib (2.4.1.0)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3589088839), installed and enabled
- `DUCKOV_PATH` set to the game root, for example `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Escape from Duckov`

Game assemblies are referenced locally with copy-local disabled. They are never committed, downloaded by CI, or included in release packages. UDS discovers the separately installed HarmonyLib at runtime and disables only healing attribution if its contracts are unavailable, its exact UDS callbacks disappear, or any foreign Harmony patch touches a required attribution method. Failed UDS unpatch cleanup remains pending and is retried; same-process reactivation is blocked until the old callbacks are removed. UDS never bundles `0Harmony.dll`.

> **Activation check:** Open **Mods** after a cold launch and confirm both HarmonyLib and UDS are active before selecting a save. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#required-harmonylib-workshop-item).

UDS fingerprints saves read-only and never modifies them. While active, it records a short-lived pre-save intent in its own external profile from Duckov's public save-collection event, so a normal save completed immediately before a crash or same-process re-selection of the current slot can retain the same UDS generation. If a save changes while UDS is inactive, that proof is unavailable and UDS conservatively archives the prior statistics generation rather than risk merging a reused slot.

## Development commands

```powershell
$env:DUCKOV_PATH = 'E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Escape from Duckov'
dotnet restore .\UltimateDuckovStatistics.sln
dotnet test .\tests\UltimateDuckovStatistics.Tests\UltimateDuckovStatistics.Tests.csproj -c Release --no-restore
dotnet build .\src\UltimateDuckovStatistics\UltimateDuckovStatistics.csproj -c Release --no-restore
```

Create the validated installable ZIP and SHA-256 sidecar with:

```powershell
.\scripts\create-release.ps1 -DuckovPath $env:DUCKOV_PATH -Version 0.2.0
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation and compatibility details.
